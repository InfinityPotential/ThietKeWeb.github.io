    <h1>Low and Slow</h1>
    <p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique
    called <b>sous vide</b>. In <dfn>sous vide</dfn> cooking, you submerge the food
    (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is
    precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be
    cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes
    is as <q><i>ultra-low-temperature proaching</i></q>.</p>
    <br><p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon</b> with Dill
    Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us
    before <time>November 30</time>.</p>

    <br><p> Warning: Sous vide cooked salmon is not <em>pasteurized</em>. Avoid it
    if you are pregnant or have imunity issues.</p>
