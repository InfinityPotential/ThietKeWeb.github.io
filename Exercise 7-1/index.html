    <h2>Pozzarello</h2>
    <p><img src="thumbnails/window_thumb.jpg" alt="view from bedroom window" width="75" height="100">The house we stayed in was called Pozzarello and it was built around the year 1200 as the home of the gardener who tended the grounds of
    the adjacent castle. The thick walls kept us nice and cool inside, despite the blistering mid-day heat. This is the view form our bedroom window.

    <h2>The Tuscan Countryside</h2>
    <p><img src="thumbnails/countryside_thumb.jpg" alt="the tuscan countryside" width="100" height="75">This is the scene on the way to Montalcino (all roads lead to Montalcino!). It looks a lot like the scene on the
    scene on the way to the grocery store. We were surrounded by beautiful Countryside for most of oar travels.

    <h2>Sienna</h2>
    <p><img src="thumbnails/sienna_thumb.jpg" alt="the streets of sienna" width="75" height="100"> closest city to our villa was Sienna, about 30 minutes away. We spent many days exploring the steep and crooked streets, sampling the
    local cuisine at outdoor restaurants, and stopping in the dark and echocy Duomo to escape the sun.
